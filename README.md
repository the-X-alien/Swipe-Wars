## SET IT UP!

 The Banker is in charge of:
 • The Terminal Microbit
 • Balance display
 • Chaos enforcement
 The Banker may play, but must keep their sabotage separate from the Bank.
 2 Power on all Microbits.
 Set the radio group to 42.
 Each player gets a Microbit card and starts with $500.
 3 Place all tokens on START.
 Set the timer to 5 minutes.
 Put the die by the board.

## PLAY!
How to win
Be the richest player when the timer ends.
Use your Microbit card to earn, spend, steal, and sabotage.


## Who goes first?
Each player rolls the die.
The highest roller starts.
On your turn
Roll the die.
Move your token clockwise that number of spaces.
Land on a tile and perform the action using your Microbit card.
Swipe at the terminal to confirm transactions.

Players may press buttons at any time, but actions only count if they are on the correct tile.

## HELP! I CAN’T PAY!
1 Try to raise money.
 Press A repeatedly to earn. (once you hit zero or you are in debt, each time you press A, you have a 5% chance of gaining $10)
 Begging is allowed, but not recommended.

 You can still continue until -$200, and then you are bankrupt and out of the game.

 Your Microbit card becomes a dummy card.
 Remaining players continue until time runs out.
